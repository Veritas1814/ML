# ðŸ§± Minecraft Floorplans

Minecraft Floorplans is an AI-based project that automatically converts 2D architectural floor plans into 3D structures in *Minecraft*.  
It combines deep learning and procedural content generation to visualize real building layouts in an interactive voxel world.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
To develop a neural network capable of recognizing and reconstructing room geometry, walls, and openings from 2D floor plans and generating accurate 3D structures directly in Minecraft

---

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results
- Accurate 3D reconstruction of walls, rooms, and doors from 2D plans  
- Fully automated import of generated structures into Minecraft 
- Visual accuracy between input plans and in-game structure
- Demonstration of AIâ€“Minecraft integration for educational and creative use
